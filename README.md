# Inhabitent Camping Supply Co.

##Technologies used:
1. Used Wordpress as a content management system
2. Started with a RED starter theme and customized it for the purpose of Inhabitent
3. Learned how to use the basics of wordpress: WP pages, plugins, dashboard features
4. Utilized custom field suite to include meta data such as product prices
5. Built custom widgets

##Personal learning:
  This project was very large and it was difficult at first locating files given the RED starter theme. Eventually, learning how to use the 
  page hierachy works in WP made it easier to use. Organization is definitely key in order to keep track of files, especially naming convention
  and keeping SASS files organized too. It was difficult targeting the specific classes at first and it caused a chain of styling problems
  because a particular styling would target multiple pages on the site. But once I understood the different page connections, I changed the php
  files accordingly to make the styling targeting clear. I feel much better and confident in my CSS/SASS skills after working through this project.
  A very great and rewarding first experience with WordPress!
